# Attack Using Kalman Filter
Using Kalman Filter tried to estimate both the private consumer data and added noise.

# Instructions to run code
1. Setup virtual environment and install requirements from requirements.txt
2. Differential privacy code is in differential_privacy.py
3. Kalman Filter code is in kalman.py
4. Results are saved in results folder
